We gather essential source materials and prepare them for acquisition, preservation, and use in meaningful teaching and listening initiatives. Through our efforts we hope to facilitate research, deepen appreciation, and broaden the listener base for the music.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Mission;\n",

The original artifacts matter</h3>\n    <p>\n      While the modern resources of music largely circulate in the digital realm, many stem from\n      physical analog originals. Having and holding these originals is vital to accessing their art\n      content and knowledge about them, so gathering and preserving them is the priority for the\n      organization. Wherever it is feasible and wise they will be applied directly in work that we\n      do or sanction.\n    </p>\n    <h3>II. We intend to honor and respect the artists whose work is involved</h3>\n    <p>\n      Crossing Tones exists in order to give appropriate credit to the creative artists who are\n      responsible for this work. Foremost those are the musicians and composers, but also include\n      photographers, writers, and graphic designers represented in our collections. To that end,\n      soliciting artists’ input in identification is a priority. Furthermore, we intend to cooperate\n      with the initiatives of those artists and their representatives and estates, and to guide\n      these decision-makers in choosing best practices for preservation, exhibition, and the future\n      disposition of their own materials.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      While Crossing Tones may take courtesy credit for commercially licensed use, and will assume\n      the rights for material in its care, the intellectual property rights of the artistic creators\n      will remain intact. Nothing can or will be done without their permission or blessing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Other rights-holders—including publishing interests, venues, etc.—may be involved; their stake\n      in the proceedings will be respected but considered secondary to that of the artists.\n    </p>\n    <h3>III. Teach it in / Teach it out</h3>\n    <p>\n      Crossing Tones exists in part for the academic benefit of the network of researchers,\n      publication interests, teachers, broadcasters, historians, and collectors. Of utmost\n      importance, though, is for the materials to be used to broaden the listener base for the\n      music. We will always advocate for free educational public programs that utilize fair use\n      doctrine to present the music and its artifacts, suitably contextualized and annotated. This\n      applies to the work we do with the materials while they are in our care, and it also is a\n      major criterion for the decision-making about where these materials will end up finally.\n    </p>\n    <h3>IV. Not all materials are of equal significance</h3>\n    <p>\n      Collecting, cataloging, and preservation will be done on a triage basis—taking into\n      consideration which items are most endangered, which are most vital to the art histories they\n      represent, and which are most kinetically in demand for research use or exhibit. Also, after\n      careful consideration, some items will not be preserved—not necessarily as a judgment of the\n      artistic value of the contents, but most often because better editions of the meaningful part\n      of the content is available from other sources.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Principles;\n",
