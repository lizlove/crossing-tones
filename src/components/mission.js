    <p>
      Crossing Tones is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that acts as an
      intermediary custodian for significant collections of Jazz music
      and related items. We gather essential source materials and
      prepare them for acquisition, preservation, and use in
      meaningful teaching and listening initiatives. Through our
      efforts we hope to facilitate research, deepen appreciation, and
      broaden the listener base for the music.
