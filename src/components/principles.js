    <h1>First Principles</h1>
    <p>
      This consortium called Crossing Tones proposes to act as custodians for collections of Jazz
      music and related material.
    </p>
    <h3>I. The original artifacts matter</h3>
    <p>
      While the modern resources of music largely circulate in the digital realm, many stem from
      physical analog originals. Having and holding these originals is vital to accessing their art
      content and knowledge about them, so gathering and preserving them is the priority for the
      organization. Wherever it is feasible and wise they will be applied directly in work that we
      do or sanction.
    </p>
    <h3>II. We intend to honor and respect the artists whose work is involved</h3>
    <p>
      Crossing Tones exists in order to give appropriate credit to the creative artists who are
      responsible for this work. Foremost those are the musicians and composers, but also include
      photographers, writers, and graphic designers represented in our collections. To that end,
      soliciting artists’ input in identification is a priority. Furthermore, we intend to cooperate
      with the initiatives of those artists and their representatives and estates, and to guide
      these decision-makers in choosing best practices for preservation, exhibition, and the future
      disposition of their own materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Crossing Tones may take courtesy credit for commercially licensed use, and will assume
      the rights for material in its care, the intellectual property rights of the artistic creators
      will remain intact. Nothing can or will be done without their permission or blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other rights-holders—including publishing interests, venues, etc.—may be involved; their stake
      in the proceedings will be respected but considered secondary to that of the artists.
    </p>
    <h3>III. Teach it in / Teach it out</h3>
    <p>
      Crossing Tones exists in part for the academic benefit of the network of researchers,
      publication interests, teachers, broadcasters, historians, and collectors. Of utmost
      importance, though, is for the materials to be used to broaden the listener base for the
      music. We will always advocate for free educational public programs that utilize fair use
      doctrine to present the music and its artifacts, suitably contextualized and annotated. This
      applies to the work we do with the materials while they are in our care, and it also is a
      major criterion for the decision-making about where these materials will end up finally.
    </p>
    <h3>IV. Not all materials are of equal significance</h3>
    <p>
      Collecting, cataloging, and preservation will be done on a triage basis—taking into
      consideration which items are most endangered, which are most vital to the art histories they
      represent, and which are most kinetically in demand for research use or exhibit. Also, after
      careful consideration, some items will not be preserved—not necessarily as a judgment of the
      artistic value of the contents, but most often because better editions of the meaningful part
      of the content is available from other sources.
