The Crossing Tones “Power Hour” is a biweekly broadcast of rare and unheard music taken from collections currently in our care. Each Power Hour is livestreamed exclusively and will not be archived, so tuning in via Zoom is the only way to experience these sounds. The Power Hour is one bloc in a potpourri of Thursday programming hosted by our friends at the Jazz History Database, the entirety of which is free and open to the public.
